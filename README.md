Legacy Bismuth Wallet

Code of the wallet is not very well organized. 
Most of it is sequential and very plain, although some classes and functions were added later. Testing and bug reports have made it quite stable and reliable.
If you are looking for a better experience, I strongly suggest you give the [Tornado wallet](https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/TornadoWallet) a try.
